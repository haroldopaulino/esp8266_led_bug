# ESP8266 - Halloween LED bug

### This project controls a 2811 LED string, by moving a couple LEDs very fast through the entire string, which gives the impression of an LED bug going from pumpkin to pumpkin, as the string coils in one pumpkin, then coils on the next pumpkin.

#### After the bug goes from the beginning to the end of the LED strip, then back to the beginning, the entire LED strip runs a rainbow effect for 5 seconds.

#### Library used to control the LEDs: Adafruit Neopixel
